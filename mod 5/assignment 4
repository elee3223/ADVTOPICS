Rewrite the rising flag animation below using a thread to MANUALLY animate the flag being raised.

You can NOT use any animation classes such as PathTransition, FadeTransition, Timeline, etc.
Manual animation is changing the visual effect of nodes manually and gradually
Raising a flag
  decreasing the y coordinate of the imageView of a flag
Lowering a flag
  increasing the y coordinate of the imageView of a flag

Using Thread.sleep to adjust the animation speed
