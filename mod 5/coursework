Assignment 4:
  Rewrite the rising flag animation below using a thread to MANUALLY animate the flag being raised.

  You can NOT use any animation classes such as PathTransition, FadeTransition, Timeline, etc.
  Manual animation is changing the visual effect of nodes manually and gradually
  Raising a flag
    decreasing the y coordinate of the imageView of a flag
  Lowering a flag
    increasing the y coordinate of the imageView of a flag

  Using Thread.sleep to adjust the animation speed

Lab 3:
  multithreading/parallel programming - concurrent output
  rewrite a given code to sychronize threads to protect each thread when updating a text area
